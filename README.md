# git_snitch
Git Snitch is an alias that allows you to quickly find out who last touched a line in your repo.

To create the alias: pull and run snitch.sh, or just copy the command out of it and run that in your shell.

To use: `git snitch <filename> <line number>`

Output looks like: `<commit hash> (<name> <timestamp>)                   <affected line>`
